🎬 Movie Search App
Welcome to my first React project – a sleek and simple Movie Search Website that lets users browse through a vast collection of films using a public API! This project was a great hands-on experience in building with React, managing components, and integrating with external APIs.

🚀 Overview
The Movie Search App allows users to:

🔍 Search for movies by title

🎥 View basic details such as title, release year, and poster

📡 Fetch real-time data from a public movie API

It’s a clean and responsive interface that makes exploring films quick and easy.

🛠️ Technologies Used
